to use the functions within this project, you would start by running the create_tables_from_csv.py file from the command line
    this will first process the schema csv file and parse it out for use in creating the necessary tables for the database.
    you can look inside the db_connection.py file for the specific db information.
    note: i fixed the CUSTOM_FIELDS.csv file 'by hand' because i couldn't get my 'csv fixer' functionality to work properly.

you can then run the data_insertion.py file to insert any necessary data into the previously created tables.

once the data is inserted into the db tables, you can run the overdrawn_balances.py file. there are no command line arguments for this function.

although i did not complete the project, i had a lot of fun working on this!
thank you so much for this opportunity
i look forward to hearing from you soon
